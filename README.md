# Customer Segmentation and Classifier


### Instructions:
1. Run the `customer_segmentation.ipynb`, or
2. Run `process_data.py` followed by `clustering.py` and `classifier.py`.
3. Access the blog post https://danielabrsil.medium.com/a-customer-segmentation-report-for-arvato-financial-services-83d459356b2a to read the documentation of this work.

### Project Motivation

The purpose of this project is to identify possible new customers for a German mail-order company, Bertelsmann Arvato. The identification of these customers is done using a supervised machine learning model, which takes into account the general demographic characteristics of the German population, as well as the results of the segmentation of these individuals through a clustering model.

### File Descriptions

There are three project components:

 1. A Python script `process_data.py`, which clean the data.
 
 2. A Python script `clustering.py` with a customer segmentation.
       
 3. A Python script `classifier.py` which classify individuals in customers or non-customers.
